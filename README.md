# INCA_download
Rountine for downloading INCA from [ZAMG data hub](https://data.hub.zamg.ac.at/).

Define a latitude-longitude box as well as start and end dates. ZAMG data hub only allows for download of smaller datasets, so for a region, e.g. Ã–tztal Alps, Tyrol, only 3 months worth of data can be downloaded at a time.
