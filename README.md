# ZAMG data hub download
Rountine for downloading INCA and other datasets from [ZAMG data hub](https://data.hub.zamg.ac.at/).

Define a latitude-longitude box as well as start and end dates. ZAMG data hub only allows for download of smaller datasets, so for a region, e.g. Ã–tztal Alps, Tyrol, only 2-3 months worth of data can be downloaded at a time.


**TODOs:**

- Remove duplicate timesteps from merged INCAfiles, solution: https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/boards/1/topics/1134
- Station data download
- Adding other gridded datasets, e.g. Winfore, APOLIS
- Update licence
