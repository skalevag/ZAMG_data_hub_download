# ZAMG data hub download
Rountine for downloading INCA and other datasets from [ZAMG data hub](https://data.hub.zamg.ac.at/).

Define a latitude-longitude box as well as start and end dates. ZAMG data hub only allows for download of smaller datasets, so for a region, e.g. Ã–tztal Alps, Tyrol, only 2-3 months worth of data can be downloaded at a time.


**TODOs:**

-[ ] Station data download
-[ ] Adding other gridded datasets, e.g. Winfore, APOLIS
